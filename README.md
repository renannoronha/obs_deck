## What is OBS Deck

OBS Deck is a Flutter app that controls OBS Studio.
For the app to work, it is required to use [obs-websocket](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket) with OBS for it to work.


## Status

Currently the app has the basic commands to control OBS. For now the app is not published, but I have plans to published it to Google Play Store in the future.
I don't have plans to publish this app to App Store, due to costs.
